# CW: Pandemic

**Pandemic is a schema similar to Severance, which was around in the OpenAura days, around 2011 and earlier. This schema was created to be a more fleshed out version of Severance, with our own features.**

Pandemic was created by [Songbird](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004520862/), explicitly for the needs of [Bitter Avalanche](http://bitter-avalanche.net/).

# Support

We're always looking for developers, and jobs can range from coding to Photoshop images and level design. Feel free to contact [Songbird](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004520862/) for more information.

You can also help us by donating to the community, which would be used for the schema and Bitter Avalanche's expansion projects.

# Disclaimer

This is our own schema with our own additions, altered to our needs. Don't like it? Nobody's forcing you to play it. The key is obviously not supported, you'd be best off checking in with Cloud Sixteen support. Support for the schema will *not* be provided by us.
