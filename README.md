# CW: Pandemic

Pandemic is created by [Songbird](http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlwaysANightmare/), explicitly for the needs of [Bitter Avalanche](http://bitter-avalanche.net/).

Pandemic is a schema close to what most know as Severance, back in OpenAura days, around 2011 and earlier. It was created to be a more fleshed out version of Severance, with our own features.

To reiterate: **This is our own schema with our own additions, and altered to our needs. Don't like it? Nobody's forcing you to play it.**
Key is obviously not supported, you'd be best off checking in with Cloud Sixteen support.

# Support

Want to support our development process? You can do so in a few ways.

We're always looking for developers, which can range from creating images in Photoshop to mappers and coders. Feel free to contact [Songbird](http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlwaysANightmare).

You can also help us by donating to the community, which would be used for the schema and Bitter Avalanche's expansion projects.
