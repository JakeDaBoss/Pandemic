# CW: Pandemic

Pandemic is created by [Songbird](http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlwaysANightmare/), explicitly for the needs of [Bitter Avalanche](http://bitter-avalanche.net/index.php)

Pandemic is a schema in liking to what most know as Severance, back in OpenAura days anno 2011 and earlier.

Pandemic was born as an idea to be a more fleshed out version of Severance, and with our own features, so to reiterate: **This is our own schema with our own additions, and altered to our needs. Don't like it? Nobody's forcing you to play it.**

Key is obviously not supported, you'd be best off checking in with Cloud Sixteen support.

# Support

Want to support our development process? You can do so in a few ways.

We're always looking for developers, which can range from creating images in PhotoShop to mappers and coders. Feel free to contact me about it. (Link to my contact info on Steam and website are above this text.)

But you can also help us by donating to the community, it will be used for the schema and Bitter Avalanche's expansion projects.
